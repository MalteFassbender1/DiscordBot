# DiscordBot
A bot to moderate a Discord server


This was my first attempt at making something in NodeJs. I always wanted to make my own Discord bot, and with the detailed online tutorials and resources it was pretty fun and rewarding. 

The bot can:
Ban/kick members with a command.
Give a role when a user joins the server and has a simple verify check to make sure bots don't spam the server.
Can delete a lot of messages at once with the !clear command.
Print out the ping from the bot itself and the discordAPI.
Display usefull information about a user (join date, avatar etc).
Log every command used and every user joined in a log channel with some neat embed.
